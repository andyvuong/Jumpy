# Jumpy
A Java library for numerical linear algebra.

## About
This library is in similiar vein to NumPy for Python and just a pet project of mine. It's written out of boredom and necessity for other projects that use Java. Maybe you'll find it useful.

This library is written by Andy Vuong, a student at UIUC.

## Notes
Current implementation is clunky in terms of performance (probably due to all the autoboxing/unboxing). This will change in the future.

## To Do:
- setValue functions for JpArray.
- Begin a wiki that documents usage.
- Vector/Matrix operations ~ add, subtract, inner product, etc.
- Numerical methods ~ matrix factorizations, gaussian elimination, etc.
- Performance optimizations.
